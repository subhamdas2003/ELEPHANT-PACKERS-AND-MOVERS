      <h3>From Humble Beginnings to Trusted Leaders</h3>
      <p>
        Founded in 2013, Elephant Movers began as a small family business with a simple vision: to make
        relocation stress-free for everyone. What started with a single truck and three dedicated team
        members has now grown into one of India's most trusted moving companies, serving thousands of
        satisfied customers across the nation.
      </p>
      <p>
        Our journey has been built on the foundation of trust, reliability, and customer satisfaction.
        Every move we handle is treated with the same care and attention as if we were moving our own
        belongings. This philosophy has earned us numerous awards and recognition in the industry.
